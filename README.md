# NLP-tasks

The files here are some of the classic tasks in natural language processing using machine learning and deep learning. Only part of the code is posted here due to course regulation.

## Files
- `NER1` -- person name detection only using logistic regression
- `NER2` -- detection of multiple named entities using HMM and CRF
- `hmm_crf.py` -- part of the code for `NER2`
- `Sentiment Analysis` -- sentiment classification using DAN, LSTM and CNN via PyTorch
- `sentiment_classification.py` -- part of the code for `Sentiment Analysis`
- `Seq2Seq QA` -- question answering through seq-to-seq model with LSTM, attention and beam search
- `seq2seq.py` -- part of the code for `Seq2Seq QA`
